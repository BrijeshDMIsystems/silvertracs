### Indoor Air Quality
<p style="text-align:justify">It is basic to good health (human & equipment) and it is expected to be free of harmful fumes, impurities and pollutants. Particles, gases and other contaminants have an impact in the continuous operations of sensitive electronic hardware causing intermittent interference or even causing actual component failures. An excessive concentration of certain gases accelerates corrosion and cause failure in electronic components. Routine sampling of the indoor air quality provides baseline data upon which recommendations can be based to maintain good quality air.</p>
