<p style="text-align:justify">Environmental Studies (Cooling and Air Distribution) of Datacenters, Labs, etc., are critical to its smooth functioning as sensitive equipment in these areas require a very balanced & specific environmental levels for its optimal operations.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Environmental Studies are offered for evaluating the cooling provided & air distribution and improving its efficiency. The following parameters are of key concern:</p>

- Temperature
- Humidity
- Air flow
- Wetness

<p style="text-align:justify">Temperature or Humidity levels outside the specified ranges, or extreme changes in conditions, can badly affect component reliability, leading to failures. The heat load of most computer rooms experiences normal fluctuations during its evolution and hence it is becomes very important to maintain appropriate temperature and RH levels at all times.</p>

The scope of work for the Cooling & Air Distribution Assessment includes:

- Temperature & Relative Humidity Profiles
- Temperature & Relative Humidity Measurements at Hardware Intakes
- Temperature & Relative Humidity Data Logging
- Conditioned Air Distribution Efficiency Assessment
- Heat Load Estimation
- Environmental Support Equipment Design and Installation Assessment
