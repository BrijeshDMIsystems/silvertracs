Technology advancement has reached a stage where almost in all areas microâ€“electronics has come to play a role. Computers, Data Processing, Computerized Numerical Control Machines, Measuring Systems and Quality Control Systems, Process Control and Industrial Automation, Medical Systems and Communication etc., all of them incorporate advanced electronics. Power and healthy environment plays a major role. 

Poor power quality, Environmental conditions, impure air, etc., affects the reliable operation of computers and computer-based equipment, which are now cannot be lived without. The loss of productivity resulting from computer equipment failure, miscalculations and downtime is a major worry. Loss in production and money spent in component replacement if estimated would be enormous.
